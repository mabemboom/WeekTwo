<!--I have added a main section for my site as this is the primary content if my site
I then added a unordered list using the ul tag and added list items using the li tag
I added a relative path to an image that is in a sub directory of the site,
added the alt tag so that should the image not load it will show that
I also added a width because it was to large for the page couldn't see it all 
without scrolling left to right-->
