List: How Dodo spends most days with Nonna - 
1 Climbs in bed with Nonna which has cause Nonna to learn to sleep in later than 7am. 
2 Zoomies - at least once a day I have to run the yard and get Nonna to play with me, this helps me to go potty.
3 Wait patiently for mom to come home she is normally home by 3:30pm but when she isn't I start to pace and bug Nonna as I miss my mom

Table Ways I have annoyed Nonna
Paw at her while she is working on her FE Course
Climb on top of her and try to laydown even though there isn't room for me
Bark for no apparent reason other than to get Nonna's attention from whatever she is doing
Sleep right under her while she is at her desk
